"""
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

    The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
    You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false

def wordBreak(s,wordDict):
	f=[False for _ in range(len(s)+1)]
	f[0]=True
	for i in range(1,len(s)+1):
		for j in range(0,i):
			if f[j] and s[j:i] in wordDict:
				f[i]=True
				break
	return f[-1]
